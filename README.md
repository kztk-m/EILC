Embedded ILC
============

This is an implementation of the unembedded EDSL for 
Giarrusso et al.'s cache-transfer style incremental 
calculus. 

To perform the experiments mentioned in the paper, run:

    sh runbench.sh sequence
    
To run the script, we need `stack`: we can install `stack` following the instructions in https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/.
